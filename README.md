# Time Managing App on Android

What to do


INIT plan:
1. Implement Countdown timer (finish time converter, only 1 timer can be on, when end should play music until press finish in new fragment (maybe stop after certain time))

2. Implement database with async and repo (design the table) (done)

3. Let timer work even after close app (maybe also move it to a new thread)

4. Implement navigator

5. Implement chart

6. Implement setting (Not sure if this is needed)

7. Implement notification


Revised plan:
1. Implement navigation drawer (not do tabbed activity anymore) (ignore)

2. Remake timer to work in background

3. Make timer work when app close

4. Implement pie chart activity

5. Clean up

6. Write report

7. Implement edit

8. Implement Timer again (done)
